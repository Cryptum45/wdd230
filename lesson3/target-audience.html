            <p>Our Target Audience is for anyone who is looking to make a difference. Those who are wanting to join a committee and change how we run 
                our town and who want to help shape what our city will be like, what stores will come in, and how big we will allow our city to grow. 
                If you are a business owner and want to be on the committee to help other small town businesses, then this is the place for you!
